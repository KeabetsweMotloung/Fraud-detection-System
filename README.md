# Fraud Detection System

This repository contains the implementation of a fraud detection system using machine learning. The goal of this project is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on various features provided in the dataset. The project includes a user-friendly web interface to interact with the model, view transaction details, and monitor real-time alerts.

## Project Overview

Fraud detection is crucial for businesses to prevent financial losses and maintain trust. This project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset to build a model capable of predicting fraudulent transactions. The web application provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring, detailed analysis of transactions, and timely alerts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which includes the following features:
- **Time**: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **V1-V28**: Anonymized features derived from PCA to ensure privacy and reduce dimensionality.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 for non-fraudulent transactions.

### Data Preparation

- Initial exploration and cleaning of the dataset.
- Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Explanation of PCA and its impact on feature extraction.

### Model Development

- Building and training a fraud detection model using algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### User Interface

- Users can input transaction details (amount, anonymized features) and get a prediction on whether the transaction is fraudulent.
- Real-time alerts for suspected fraudulent transactions.
- Visualizations for detailed transaction analysis.

## Installation

**Note**: Ensure you are using Python 3.x and have all necessary system dependencies installed.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset according to the instructions provided.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance.
3. **User Interface**: Input transaction details into the web application and receive fraud predictions.

## Results

The model demonstrates the ability to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The web interface allows for easy interaction, real-time monitoring, and detailed transaction analysis.
